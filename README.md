# **Chat application**

### **Motivation for the project:**

#### I wanted to learn more about firebase and also try a new way of doing CSS so I used MaterialUI too.

</br>

I built the application with: 
- React JS
- Firebase
- Material UI

### **What did I learn about during the project?**

- authentication(registering & signing in users through firebase)
- navigation on the website
- creating a private chat between 2 people with unique IDs
- sending, receiveing, deleting messages through firebase
- getting more comfortable with React hooks
